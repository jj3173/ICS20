	<h2> Possible Career Path For Me </h2>
	<p> The area of programming that I found the most interesting is CSS, creating animations using Java or JavaScript. In computer science I'm interested in pursing a job as a graphic designer. They create visual designs, using computer software, to communicate ideas attract consumers. They work with both art and technology to communicate idea though different medias, such as websites, brochures, and printed pages.</p>
	<h3>Courses in High School</h3>
	<p> In High School students interested in graphic design should take basicn art courses (Visual Arts), desgin courses (Graphic Designs), and computer sciences to learn coding. </p>
	<h3>Program to Study at University</h3>
	<p> It's suggested to major degree in the Arts and obtain a minor degree in Computer Science as well. </p> 
	<h3>Specific Topic</h3>
	<h3>Changes in the Future</h3>
	<p>The employment for graphic designers isn't bond to change much from 2014-2024. However, the methods of production to create these products will change as technology the increase of technology developement. </p>
