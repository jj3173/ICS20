	<h1>Soccer game</h1>

	<p>Bob wants to practice shooting for his next soccer game. Press the mouse to make Bob appear. If Bob misses the ball, another one will be sent his way. If he does hit it, it will bounce back either from the the net or the wall on the left. If it hits any of the other walls, the ball will disappear and he would fail. The score on the left represents how many he kicked and the right is how many he missed.</p>
