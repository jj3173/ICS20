	<h1>Requirements for my Video Game</h1>
	
	<p>For my summative I want to create a game where the character of my game, has to conquer different obstacles in his way. This includes moving to jump on top of these obstacles, ducking underneath and squishing between the objects. The start screen will contain the highest scores achieved in this game, as well as the name of the game in big lettering. In order to start the game, the player must click any location on the screen.  The score system tracks how far the character travels, the longer time and farther distance traveled obtains more points. Thereâ€™s no way of winning this game, but the more points accumulated means a better performance. The game ends when the player runs into contact with any of the obstacles or if there moving to slow that they disappear from the frame. The player will control things by using the arrows found on the keyboard. In the game, the player will use their set of arrows to control their character by moving them up, down, forwards and backwards. </p>
