	<h1>Summative Game</h1>
 
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p><b>These are a few requirements for my game:</b></p>
	<ul>
	   <li>The characters in my game are going to be Mario (controled by the player) and the Bullet/Fireball (who is the opponent).</li>
	   <li> The score will be displayed on the right side of the screen and will be tracked by the number of opponents Mario can dodge before dying. </li>
	   <li> To earn bonus points to add on to the score, the player can control Mario to eat the donuts. Each donut will be worth an extra 2 points. </li>
	   <li>The starting screen of the game is title of the game and a start button underneath. Mario will also appear on the screen to help the player visualize how to control Mario.</li>
	   <li>When the player is ready to start the game, they can tap anywhere on screen with the mouse.</li>
	   <li>The point of this game is to dodge all the Bullets by controling Mario with the set of arrows and the keypad.</li>
	   <li>When the player gets to a certain score (10 points), there will be an additional opponent that would appear, the Fireball.</li>
	   <li>If the Bullet or the Fireball hits Mario, the Game Over screen will be displayed. </li>
	   <li>There is no way in winning this game, it's better to accumulate more points than less. </li>
           <li>To restart the game, the user must refresh the page.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Planning</h2>
	<p><b>Some new p5 codes I would need to learn in order to create my games are the following:</b></p>
	<ul>
	   <li>Setting an image as the background</li>
	   <li>Using images in general, to represent characters.</li>
	   <li>Adding sound to my video game. </li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>To create this game, some functions I would require would include:</b></p>
 	<ul>
	   <li><b>function mouseClicked:</b> used to start the game</li>
	   <li><b>function keyPressed:</b> used to control Mario from dodging away from the opponents</li>
	   <li><b>function preload:</b> used to load the music used in the game before it starts</li>
	   <li><b>function setup:</b> setup the images and canvas</li> 
	   <li><b>function draw:</b> everything that occurs in the game</li> 
	</ul>
