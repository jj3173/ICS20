	<h1>Make It Rain</h1>
	
	<p> This was a porject that I completed on KhanAcademy, but I transfered the code to suit p5. In this project, I learned how to use mouse controls and loops. The loops give the raindrops the raindrop effect falling over and over. To add on, I learned how to make computer generated random colours to make the raindrops look rainbow like!</p>
